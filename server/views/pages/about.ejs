        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Stephen Bayer and I am a full time software engineer.  For as long as I could remember,
            it is the only job I wanted to do.  Even as a child, barely out of toddler-hood, I would set up my
            bedroom into a fantasy software shop, coding dumb games on my TRS-80, with my stuffed bear, Curly Hair
            Window Pane, as my QA manager.  The bear did not have curly hair, nor did it look like an architectural
            fixture of any kind, so I'm unsure of how I came up with that name.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of software, I am passionate about a few other things. These are enumerated and organized on a
            separate <a href="/interests">interests page</a>.  (as of the time that this paragraph is being written,
            the interests page isn't completely finished, but I'm assuming something cat related will be toward the
            top)
        </p>

        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted this site to be completely me.  All pictures and html and code written from scratch from the
            ground up, no boiler plates, no templates.  I also wanted it to be obviously a personal website and not a
            business website, unpolished, devoid of clip art and bright stock photos of people in suits shaking hands,
            and, as much as possible, an honest representation of me.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also wanted and will continue to use this site as a learning experience for web based software
            development stacks, tools, and deployment techniques.  As such, after initial deployment, I will probably
            be attempting to constantly update with new content and update existing pages.  Currently, the site is
            straight HTML being served from a bare bones nodejs/express server.  But, my first transition is going to
            be to update the pages  Angular to handle more of the app centric sections I am working on, such as the
            blog, photo gallery, and events page.  I feel this is going to be a fun learning experience moving
            to a server based Angular site and setting up deployment to a cloud service.
